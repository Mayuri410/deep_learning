# deep_learning
For My work in Deep learning Domain, I have Created 3 task for my deep learning project.
- ⦁ Lyric Genre PredictionTask Using RNN, LSTM, CNN & Non Neural Network Models.

- ⦁ Transfer Learning
    Using Models generated from Lyric Genre Prediction Task we will predict Artist name using lyrics on the same dataset as task uno.
- ⦁ Writing your own Episode of House
      In this part, we are going to write to write dialogue excerpts from a TV show. This involves generating words by language modelling techniques using LSTM and     statistical modelling. We are going to measure the model performance in terms of perplexity
